In order to test our program, we created a directory with multiple directories inside of it each leading to a few other directories that all had .txt, .hcz, and other files. To test our non recursive build, compress, and decompress functions, we ran our tests on different files within the testing directory that we made. We tested edge cases with all of the different escape characters in different positions, and made sure incorrect inputs displayed the appropriate error messages. After successful testing, we ran our code through valgrind to make sure that there were no memory leaks before we moved on to the recursive implementation of fileCompressor. We then moved on to creating a recursive function that traverses the directory implementing the desired function (build, compress, or decompress) on every valid file found. After it passed our testing, we were finished and started to implement other error checks in our code to finish. We used our makefile to automate running our testing as well as gdb to fix bugs.
